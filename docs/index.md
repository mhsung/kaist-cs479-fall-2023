## Description
3D Data (both 3D scans captured by depth sensors and 3D models created by designers) are widely used in many applications in computer vision, computer graphics, and robotic, such as autonomous driving, AI-assisted 3D object/scene design, augmented reality, and physical robot interaction. Along with the recent increasing demands on processing and analyzing such 3D data, there has been tremendous progress in developing novel technologies, especially based on deep learning. In this course, we will cover the recent advances in machine learning techniques for 3D data and also discuss the remaining challenges. Most of the course material will be less-than-5-year-old research papers in CVPR/ICCV/ECCV (Vision), SIGGRAPH/SIGGRAPH Asia (Graphics), and NeurIPS/ICML (Machine Learning). The course will be project-oriented (no exam, no paper-and-pencil homework, but easy programming assignment), and it will combine pedagogical lectures and seminar-style reading group presentations (followed by interactive discussions). 


## Prerequisites
This course is intended for undergraduate/master students who have a basic background in deep learning and experience with PyTorch.

## AI Coding Assistant Tool Policy

**You are allowed (and even encouraged) to utilize AI coding assistant tools**, such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Codex, and Code Intelligence, for your programming assignments and projects. Utilizing AI coding assistant tools will not be deemed as plagiarism. However, it is still strictly prohibited to directly copy code from the Internet or from someone else. Doing so will lead to a score of zero and a report to the university.
